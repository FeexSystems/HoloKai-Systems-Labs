      "A living keeper of oral memory, trained to listen for cadence, silence, and the call-and-response patterns that carry knowledge across generations. Its vocal mesh is trained on rare archival recordings spanning Mandé, Igbo, Zulu, and Ethiopian oral lineages. It does not merely recite—it improvises responsively, modulating pitch, rhythm, and proverb density in real time.",
    culturalResonance:
      "Inspired by the griots of the Mali Empire and their counterparts across the continent, Oluwa-Core carries forward the responsibility of memory-keeper. Its chassis features micro-etched Adinkra and Nsibidi-inspired resonators that vibrate in sympathy with traditional instruments.",
